## 3. Project Overview  
This app uses a lesson-based system inspired by Duolingo to teach users essential personal finance concepts. Users progress through interactive lessons, quizzes, and streak rewards, building practical financial knowledge in a gamified, engaging way. The content covers budgeting, saving, investing, credit, and more.  
**Interactivity is a core requirement**—lessons should feel like playing a game, with immediate feedback, dynamic animations, drag-and-drop activities, and real-time scoring.

## 4. Problem Statement
